## LGF-Web-App ##


DESCRIPTION

LGF Web App is an app developed to enhance the workflow of researchers associated with Laborat√≥rio de Genoma Funcional (LGF), a research institution based at State Universit of Campinas (UNICAMP).


FEATURES

Its current features include an equipment booking manager, a reagent ordering tool, a bank of usefull spreadsheets, and user authentication with google account.
As the app the app was designed specifically for the use of researchers associated with LGF, for the moment, only users with google accounts associated with the institution are allowed to login and use its features. 


TECHNOLOGIES

- Back-end: NodeJs with ExpressJs, MongoDB with Mongoose, and user authentication is handled with PassportJs.
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and EJS (Server side rendered).
These technologies were used due to the practicality they offered me back when I started developing the app. Currently, I'm rewriting the app using the MERN stack, as I believe this will enhace its performance and deliver a better UX.


ACCESS

- The app is currently hosted by a server of Institute of Biology (UNICAMP), and can be accessed on https://www.lgfwebapp.ib.unicamp.br/
